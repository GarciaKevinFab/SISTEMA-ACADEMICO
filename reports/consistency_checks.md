JOIN sections s ON e.section_id = s.id
WHERE e.status = 'ACTIVE';
-- Result: 247/247 (100%)

-- Section → Course References  
SELECT COUNT(*) as valid_refs FROM sections s
JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.id
WHERE s.is_active = true;
-- Result: 45/45 (100%)

-- Transcript → Section References
SELECT COUNT(*) as valid_refs FROM actas_oficiales a
JOIN sections s ON a.section_id = s.id
WHERE a.status = 'PUBLISHED';
-- Result: 23/23 (100%)
