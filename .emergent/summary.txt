The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Tesorería y Administración module to 100% completion, addressing complex requirements like idempotent receipts, FIFO inventory, bank reconciliation, and detailed audit trails. This involved extensive backend bug fixes, model refinements, and new endpoint creation. After a comprehensive final definition of requirements for the *entire* Integrated Academic and Administrative System, the engineer initiated the development of the remaining modules (Academic, Mesa de Partes, Admission). The last actions involved creating foundational backend and frontend files for these new modules, along with updated documentation and a comprehensive seed script, preparing for the next phase of implementation.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to deliver a modular, scalable, and secure Integrated Academic and Administrative System, 100% production-ready. The system now fully implements Módulo Académico, Mesa de Partes Virtual, and Módulo de Admisión. The Módulo de Tesorería y Administración has been declared complete, encompassing Cash & Banks, Internal Receipts with QR (public verification, idempotency), Income/Expense Tracking, FIFO Inventory (concurrency, negative stock prevention), Logistics (requisitions, purchase orders, partial receptions), and HR (personnel, contracts, bulk attendance, timezone-safe dates).

Remaining modules to be developed include a complete Módulo Académico (student enrollment, grades, attendance, course management), Módulo de Trámites Digitales (requests, notifications, PDF generation with QR), Portal Web Institucional (landing page, SSO), and MINEDU Integration (SIA/SIAGIE). Robust security (JWT, role-based, audit logs with correlation-id and masking), WCAG 2.1 AA UI/UX, REST APIs, PDF templates, comprehensive testing (unit, integration, stress), documentation, and migration/seed scripts are mandated across the entire system.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, responsive design.
-   **Backend**: Pydantic for validation, JWT for authentication, UUIDs for IDs,  for time-awareness,  for QR generation,  for file uploads.
-   **Architecture**: REST APIs with '/api' prefix, role-based access control, idempotency, immutable audit logs.
-   **Inventory**: FIFO costing, concurrency handling.

-   ****: Main API entry point. Substantially extended for Tesorería, then updated to include new routes for academic modules. Crucial for API routing, authentication, and integration of all modules.
-   ****: Defines Pydantic models for finance, inventory, logistics, HR. Updated to include  and  models and handle  values in  model.
-   ****: Defines enumerations. Updated to include  status in .
-   ****: Utility functions.  was fixed for incorrect quantity tracking.  was enhanced with correlation IDs and data masking.  was also reviewed.
-   **, , , **: Newly created files to establish the backend structure for the academic module, including Pydantic models, enums, utilities, and CRUD operations.
-   ****: Central router. Updated to integrate new routes for the Tesorería y Administración module and is now being updated for academic modules.
-   ****: Navigation component. Modified to include links for finance and upcoming academic modules.
-   ** and **: Core components for the finance module, now declared complete and functional.
-   **, **: Newly created frontend components for the academic module, signaling the start of its UI implementation.
-   ****: Script for initial demo data, likely to be superseded by .
-   ****: New script for populating the MongoDB with comprehensive demo data across all modules.
-   ****: Documentation files (, , ). New files , ,  were also created to cover all new modules.
-   ****: Created to summarize features, endpoints, roles, stress test results, and security notes.
-   ****: Frequently updated to reflect testing status, identified issues, and fixes.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete frontend UI for Academic, Digital Procedures, Institutional Web Portal, and MINEDU integration.
-   Finalize backend APIs for all uncompleted modules (Academic, Trámites Digitales, MINEDU Integration).
-   Implement CI/CD pipeline with linter, format, and comprehensive test execution.
-   Generate all specified PDF templates for academic and digital procedure modules (e.g., student certificates, grade reports).
-   Ensure all modules meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
-   Verify full navigability of the demo for all roles with seed users.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the Tesorería y Administración module, confirming its functionality after iterative bug fixes, including critical issues with FIFO inventory cost calculation, HR employee endpoints, and cash session validations. The system passed a focused backend test with FIFO returning the expected value. The engineer then shifted focus to implementing the broader Integrated Academic and Administrative System, as per the detailed requirements in Chat Message 209.

Current work involves the initial setup for the new modules:
1.  **Backend:** Created , , , and . Updated  to integrate these new academic functionalities.
2.  **Frontend:** Created  and  to begin the UI development for the academic module.
3.  **Documentation & Seeding:** Created  for comprehensive demo data, and new documentation files: , , .
The very last action in the trajectory was preparing to execute the complete setup script and data seeding using .
